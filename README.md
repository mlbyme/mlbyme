# 👋 Hey, I'm ML by Me

Welcome to my GitHub!

I'm documenting my journey to become a Machine Learning Engineer - one day, one commit, one post at a time.

This space is where I share my daily learnings, code snippets, projects, and reflections as I build my skills in ML, AI, and everything around them.

---

### 🚀 Why I'm Building in Public

- To stay consistent and accountable in my learning.
- To create a visible track record for future opportunities.
- To connect with other curious learners and engineers.
- To leave behind proof of work - not just certificates.

---

### 📅 What I’m Learning (Right Now)

For the first 30–60 days, I’m focusing on:
- 🧠 **DSA with C++**
- 📊 **SQL**
- 📐 **Mathematics for ML**

Then moving into:
- 🐍 Python for ML
- 🤖 AI/ML/DL/NLP/LLMs
- ⚙️ MLOps, Docker, Cloud (AWS/GCP)

### 🛠️ Repositories

- [`ml-by-me`](https://github.com/mlbyme/ml-by-me) – My main repo: daily logs, notes, code snippets, and learning experiments
- More projects coming as I progress 💡

### ✍️ Blog

I’ll be posting longer reflections and summaries here:  
🔗 [mlbyme.hashnode.dev](https://mlbyme.hashnode.dev) *(coming soon)*

### 🧠 Goals for Now

- Show up every day — even if just a small push
- Make GitHub green for 6 months straight 💚
- Stay consistent through writing, building, and sharing
- Learn in public. Grow in public.
